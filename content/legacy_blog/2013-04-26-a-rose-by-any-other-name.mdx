I posted [an
article](https://joelhooks.com/blog/2013/04/24/modeling-data-and-state-in-your-angularjs-application/#comment-875747843) about using models to assist in creating leaner, meaner controllers. It resulted in a lively conversation in the comments that spawned an interesting [rebuttal](https://wekeroad.com/2013/04/25/models-and-services-in-angular) from [Rob Conery](https://twitter.com/robconery) that essentially says I am full of it, and the names I attach to the patterns I use are wrong.

**This is probably true.**

With that truth understood, I also don't go around pulling made up nonsense
definitions out of my ass. The models bit is battle-tested real working
patterns, on a large project, with a good sized team. The terms I use come from
a mix of sources, with roots in GoF patterns and through my continued education.
It is **not** personal terminology.

The whole situation reminded me of [this
post](https://plus.google.com/app/basic/stream/z13vitkjpya0zxcee23ztzmqcor3fzen2) from Igor Minar, regarding
AngularJS's status as an MV-WHATEVER framework. For whatever reason, people name
things differently for different reasons. Naming is **hugely** important for our
common understanding of things. Up to a point. To take an example from
non-coding life, on a recent trip to Italy, I had _no clue_ what the name of
anything was. A combination of handwaving, pointing, and nodding was more
effective than one might think. In some ways, this is true for programming as
well. As long as we eventually agree to build the same thing, it will probably
be **OK**.

The conversation came to an abrupt end. My son witnessed the tragic and brutal
death of a man that we both have a lot of respect for. I was involved with
notifying people of the incident, and it was a really difficult situation. The
Disqus notifications were too much, so I disabled the comment thread. Rob
subsequently attempted to delete his comments (which is a shame, but
understandable) so he is the "guest" commentor. Normally I love a good debate,
and this is the first time I've ever done this sort of thing. Rob expressed
extreme displeasure and took it as a personal insult. Hopefully he understands
that it is not, and my desire is that we pick up the conversation again one day. Perhaps via a different medium?

I find it highly interesting that two people could have such wildly different
world views when it comes to naming patterns. It would be great to get to the
bottom of it, and I suspect in the end we would both be smarter for it.

I've got a fairly strict rule about not posting non-technical stuff here, so
this post is an anomolly. I won't make a habit of stopping conversations, and
wanted to put this out here, as it relates directly with this space.
