For as long as I can remember, all of my computer upgrades have been "bigger and
badder." Outside of moving from a FULL ATX DESKTOP WORKSTATION to a laptop,
Moore's law has played out nicely. Every few years I'd get something bigger and
better.

Not this time.

After several years of lugging around a 15" MBP, I decided on a change. Instead
of a beast, I went with a dainty 11" MacBook Air. And I love it.

### Specs

- 11.6" glossy screen 1366 by 768 (native) resolution
- 8gb of RAM
- 2.0 ghz dual core i7
- 512gb SSD hardrive

I think we can agree that this is _not too shabby_. My biggest concerns were
power and the shortness of the screen itself.

### Power

I've got no complaints in this department. It is almost exactly the same (spec
wise) as my 2010 MBP. It is even a touch faster with the SSD. I had an SSD
system drive in my MBP, but everything on SSD definitely makes a difference.

My typical workday involves an open copy of WebStorm, Sublime Text 2, a terminal
session running various servers, a VM running a server instance, Chrome with an
excessive amount of tabs, Skype, Adium... you get the picture. I'm a **power**
user ;).

This thing can **hang**.

Sure, I would **love** to have 16gb of ram and a quad core (not hyperthreaded)
cpu. I will have my credit card poised and ready when that beast arrives, but
I'm able to _get shit done_ without hinderence.

### The Screen

It is small. It isn't much bigger than an iPad. And that is awesome. It is so
small. I love it. I want to put it in my pocket. It won't actually fit in my
pocket (the iPad mini is already there), but it is **so light**. Have you ever
been at a conference and felt like a sherpa cresting the peak at Everest at the
end of a day toting around your 15" monster? Maybe that is just me, but that
won't be a problem with this little guy.

Sure, it is short, but it hasn't been an issue. I've had to be a little more
"dynamic" with my font sizes, but overall I've been able to spend hours reading
and doing work on the laptop and it hasn't been a hinderence. It certainly isn't
a problem when it is docked and hooked up to the 27" display!

### Staying Small

I don't know what would compel me to get a gigantor laptop again at this point.
This thing is rad. My only real beef with it is the eensie weensie `<esc>` key. It
is a little tough to get at if you use VIM regularly. Luckily that is easy to
solve with some key remapping. Otherwise, I have absolutely zero buyer's remorse
and look forward to having a computer onhand more often, as I will be much more
likely to tote it with me when I go out. I'm looking forward to the [11" Muzetto
from SFBags](https://sfbags.com/products/muzetto/muzetto.php) to show up.

If you're looking to drop some weight from your laptop bag, you really can't go
wrong with the Air. I'm impressed.

On another note, I setup the new machine using
[Boxen](https://boxen.github.com/), and it was _awesome_. I ran into a few snags,
but it is so cool to have a basic configuration version controlled. I can
literally go from fresh install of OS X to working in under an hour now. I plan
on writing my thoughts on that and will post it here soon.
