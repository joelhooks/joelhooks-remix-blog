Knowledge Adventure Clubs are the intersection of book clubs and Dungeons &
Dragons.

When I was in Jr High I'd show up to school carrying a leather briefcase. Inside
of that case there were several thick books, paper, and a bunch of oddly-shaped
dice.

I'd sit down at a lunch room table, crack open the briefcase, and spread out my
nerdy treasure hoping somebody else would take interest in this fantasy realm
with me.

Nobody did üòÇ

But, for almost 40 years I've been interested in the game of Dungeons & Dragons,
or D&D. It's a fascinating table-top, roleplaying game invented in the 70s that
has seen a massive resurgence in recent years. D&D provides a ruleset for
creating and adventuring in fantastic worlds where your fate is decided by your
wits and, often, the roll of a 20-sided dice.

Traditionally, one of the difficult aspects of D&D is finding somebody who is
willing to be the dungeon master (DM). This individual organizes the game, sets
the stage, and plays the role of "the universe" for the players.

It's a tough job. It's a lot of work. It can also be deeply rewarding and fun,
but takes practice and patience.

Book clubs are easier to understand. If you haven't played D&D, maybe you've
participated in a book club.

If not, the concept probably isn't as foreign, but as I was reading this
wonderful set
of [Alexandrian patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander)
from Joshua Kerievsky
called [Knowledge Hydrant: A Pattern Language for Study Groups](https://www.industriallogic.com/papers/khdraft.pdf)
it struck me:

D&D and book clubs are very similar.

The patterns line up. My little diagram captures some of the primary
similarities, but you can keep going and the ideas converge in a wonderfully
interesting way!

It gets even more interesting when you apply the depth of thought that exists on
the internet around designing and running a successful D&D group to creating and
running book clubs and study groups. The valuable outcomes are us leveling up in
our knowledge and careers.

We can study the patterns of Game Masters to design and faclitate
shared-learning experiences that can have a huge impact. ü§Ø

Here are some of my favorite resources for new Game Masters. If any of this
sounds interesting, I'd highly recommend exploring them yourself. If you've
never played D&D, don't worry, they don't assume a lot of knowledge. I think
you'll "get it" without problem.
