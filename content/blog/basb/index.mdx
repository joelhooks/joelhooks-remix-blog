Building a Second Brain is [a course](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) from Tiago Forte that presents a structured approach to consuming knowledge for interative understanding.

It's rooted in Getting Things Done and the idea of [progressive summarization](/progressive-summarization). Tiago also presents the PARA approach as a taxonomy for high level organization of the artifacts that result from summarizing the content you consume.

My favorite [summary of the Second Brain course is from Maggie Appleton and includes a lovely set of illustrated notes](https://maggieappleton.com/basb).
