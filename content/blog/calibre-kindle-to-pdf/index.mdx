Calibre can be used to convert kindle books to PDF by installing a plugin called DeDRM_tools. You'll need the serial number of [your Kindle device](https://www.amazon.com/mycd). As far as I know this only works with books you've purchased and if you own a Kindle.

1. Install [Calibre v4.20.0](https://calibre-ebook.com/download_osx)
1. Download the latest release of DeDRM_tools v6.8.0 from [their Github releases page](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases)
1. Open calibre's Preferences dialog 
1. Click on the "Plugins" button
1. click on the button, "Load plugin from file"
1. Navigate to the unzipped DeDRM_tools folder
1. find the file `DeDRM_plugin.zip`  
1. Click to select the file and select "Open"
1. Click "Yes" in the "Are you sure?" dialog box
1. Click the "OK" button in the "Success" dialog box
1. Enter your [Kindle Device's](https://www.amazon.com/mycd) serial number in the customisation dialog for `eInk Kindle Books`
1. Be sure to click `OK` and not `Cancel`
1. In your [Kindle Content list](https://www.amazon.com/mycd), click the `...` "actions" button for the book you want to convert
1. Click `download & transfer to USB`
1. Select the device that matches the serial number above
1. Drag the downloaded file onto Calibre
1. Click `Convert books` in Calibre
1. Choose the format you want and click `OK`

Now after a brief wait you'll have **a PDF file that can be opened and annotated wherever you please**.

I highly recommend [PDF Expert and an iPad Pro w/ the Pencil 2](/pdf-expert).
