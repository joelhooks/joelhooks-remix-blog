Over the last few years, we've done **a lot** of [React](https://next.egghead.io/q/react). Which is great. I love using React personally, and building [egghead-next](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-next) using Next.js and TypeScript has been fantastic.

This year we'd like to give some of the other great frameworks and tools the stage while continuing to help folks learn React.

**Vue** ([link](https://next.egghead.io/q/vue)]

We've got a modest stack of Vue courses, but none that present the current version. Feels like there is a lot of room for both the fundamentals, as well as project-oriented courses using Vue.

Also very interested in Nuxt and that ecosystem.

**Svelte** ([link](https://next.egghead.io/q/svelte))

Svelte is incredibly interesting and a tool a lot of developers would benefit from learning.

I'd love to go deep with Svelte and present it in a way that shows folks the power and benefits of using this tool. That means a "flagship" course as well as project-oriented courses to use Svelte in various ways ("Build an X with Svelte")

**Alpine** ([link](https://next.egghead.io/q/alpine))

I haven't spent much time with Alpine personally, but I love the ethos and minimal approach. It's valuable and valid to use something ultra-lightweight, both in bytes but also API surface area.

Simon Vrachliotis's "[getting started with Alpine](https://next.egghead.io/playlists/sprinkle-declarative-reactive-behaviour-on-your-html-with-alpine-js-5f8b)" course is a lovely intro, but I'd love to have some composed curriculum as well as project-oriented courses around Alpine.

**Hotwire**

This is the new tool stack from the folks at Basecamp that was developed out of their work on Hey, and I think it has a lot of potential

This feels like something that would be excellent for project-oriented examples and a solid approach to building a lot of great apps for a developer's project portfolio.

We want to give people the pre-requisites they need to do project work with a variety of tools so that they can craft [developer portfolios](/developer-portfolio) that help them get good/better jobs as web developers. That goal can take a lot of shapes!

I'm probably missing other great tools, so please don't hesitate to [reply to this Twitter thread and let me know](https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1347595091989315585) what else you'd like to see in this list.
