I've spent a lot of time freelancing and will be filling this page in with what I know about doing it.

Generally I send people to two resources:

* [Double Your Freelancing from Brennan Dunn]()
* [Kai Davis]()

Both of these fellas produce amazing legit useful free content and have offerings for you to upgrade to paid products. The paid products are **really fucking good**. They are the real deal. If you can swing it, you should consider upgrading.

Their free stuff is enough to get you started and freelancing for money though, so don't feel like you have to buy to be successful. You don't.

I'm always happy to help. Send me an email or DM me on Twitter.
