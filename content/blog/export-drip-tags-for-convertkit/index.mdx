If you need to migrate your email list subscribers from Drip to [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com?lmref=ia534A), you will run into the problem of importing each of your tags as an individual list into [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com?lmref=ia534A).

If you follow the [official recommendation][^1], they suggest that you export each individual tag from Drip. With each export taking 3 minutes to 12 hours, you could be there for a long long time.

To solve this for myself, I [wrote a simple node.js script][^2] that reads in the subscribers.csv that contains ALL of my subscribers and parsed it to create individual csv files for each tag.

This saved me a shitload of time!
